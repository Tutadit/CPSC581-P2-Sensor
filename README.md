# CPSC581-P2-Sensor
CPSC581 Project 2: Design and implement an alternative to "Slide to Unlock" using sensor(s)

## Project of choice: TBD
## Project site: http://cpsc581.p2.2.osloz.com
## Structure:

Super simple html app here:

* ```index.html``` - Start of app
* ```js/``` - JavaScript scripts
* ```js/start``` - Start of custom scripts
* ```css/``` - Stylesheets go here
* ```css/style.css``` - Main stylesheet
I've gone ahead and added the latest JQuery to the app. But other than that this is a basic html/js/css application. 

I've got this project hosted at https://cpsc581.p2.2.osloz.com, with a basic CI system. And by basic I mean basic, the contents of this repository are cloned to the server where this project resides.

Anytime a push is made onto the main branch the deployment process clones this repo on the server. Changes should be live within the minute.


### Make your life easier

If you use *vscode* install [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extention. It automatically reloads any file you change, very nice.
